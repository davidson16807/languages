		the following characters have special meaning in code, they should not be used unless their behavior is intended:	
		some characters here are deliberate homoglyphs since these characters are not likely to occur for other reasons,	
		however users should be careful not to mistake control characters for their more common lookalikes	
		since more common lookalikes will appear in text as usual

"""∅"""	""""""	a valid inflection that is indicated by the absence of text, any mention of this character will be replaced with an empty string	
"""—"""	N/A	does not exist, statements that would use this inflection are unlikely or would be rephrased, any card that includes this character will be omitted	
❕	N/A	deliberately omitted for pragmatic reasons, any card that includes this character will be omitted	
❔	N/A	unattested, unreliable, or unknown to exist, any card that includes this character will be omitted	
"""…"""	"""…"""	unknown but likely to have existed and necessary to demonstrate other known inflections, cards that include this character will only be omitted if the character is enclosed in a clozure	
""""""	"""..."""	unintentionally omitted since it allows us to easily spot errors in deck specification
