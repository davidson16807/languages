		the following characters have special meaning in code, they should not be used unless their behavior is intended:
		some characters here are deliberate homoglyphs since these characters are not likely to occur for other reasons,
		however users should be careful not to mistake control characters for their more common lookalikes
		since more common lookalikes will appear in text as usual
tabular form	rendered as	behavior
"""∅"""	""""""	this text represents a valid inflection that is indicated by the absence of text, any mention of this character will be replaced with an empty string
"""—"""	N/A	this text represents an inflection that does not exist, any card that includes this character will be omitted
❕	N/A	this text represents an inflection that is deliberately omitted for pragmatic reasons, any card that includes this character will be omitted
❔	N/A	this text represents an inflection that is unattested, unreliable, or unknown to exist, any card that includes this character will be omitted
"""…"""	"""…"""	this text represents an inflection that is unknown but likely existed and must be rendered to demonstrate other inflections that are known, cards that include this character will only be omitted if the character is enclosed in a clozure
""""""	"""..."""	this text displays when an inflection is unintentionally omitted since it allows us to easily spot errors in deck specification
