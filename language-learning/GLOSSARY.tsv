	
function	a python function, or (more generally) any implementation of a mathematical function
operation	as per Stepanov (2009), any function that maps to and from objects of the same type
	
text	"a string of characters (the label ""text"" is chosen for brevity)"
token	a text composed entirely of nonwhitespace characters
term	an indivisible unit that is associated with a predefined token, such as a phone, morph, seme, tag, etc.
facet	an indivisible unit of articulation that can be combined with others to create a phone, such as voicing, manner of articulation, etc.
phone	"an indivisible unit of sound capable creating distinction in meaning in any attested natural language. it is a product of ""features"": manner, place, voicing, etc."
morph	an indivisible unit of sound capable of conveying meaning in any attested natural language. it is a product of phonemes.
seme	an indivisible unit of meaning that fully describes the meaning of any morpheme in any attested natural language. it is a product of episemes.
tag	an indivisible unit of distinction between any set of morphemes or their arrangement in any attested natural language.
episeme	an indivisible unit of meaning that is mutually exclusive to other members in a episemaxis
	
*eme	an indivisible unit within the context of a specific language, such as a phoneme, morpheme, etc.
*axis	a set of sets containing terms
*space	a cartesian product of axes
*mask	a subset of a space
*point	an element within a space
*path	a sequence of points within a space
*field	an operation between spaces
	
dict/dictionary	a python dictionary
list	a python list
	
*store	a representation of a collection of any kind in memory, including spaces, masks, paths, sets, fields, etc.
*series	any store that allows traversal but forbids tests of membership in the interest of performance
*set	any store that forbids traversal but allows tests of membership
*lookup	any store that represents a function
*tree	a store of nested series
*node	a member of a tree
	
*whitelist	a mask that specifies elements that are included in a store
*blacklist	a mask that specifies elements that are excluded in a store
*traversal	a path that specifies the order in which inflections are to be demonstrated
	
*indexing	a technique for representing and iterating through dictionaries, typically in a dictset or dictspace
*annotations	a technique for interpreting cells within a table as dictionaries
*evaluations	a technique for interpreting annotations as the contents of stores
*population	a technique for creating new stores given annotations an evaluations
	
context-free grammar	a context-free grammar as understood in the theory of computation
rule	a representation of a rule in a context-free grammar
	
listtree	a tree where nodes are lists or strings
ruletree	a tree where nodes are rules
syntax tree	a listtree that represents meaning in a language agnostic fashion that's standardized across this body of work
	
nodemap	a function that, when given a context, maps between nodes of a tree
treemap	an operation that maps between trees
	
semantics	a language-specific series of fields that map an episemespace to tags
grammar	a language-specific a series of fields that map tagspace to text representing inflection
syntax	a language-specific operator mapping ruletrees
	
script	an inventory of characters
language	a function that, when given a script, maps a syntax tree to text
orthography	a tuple of language and script
demonstration	the representation of a seme in a given orthography
card	a Anki card, which consists of a series of demonstrations that each represent the same seme
