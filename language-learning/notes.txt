problems:
* difficulty in specifying decks for new languages
* difficulty in working with non indo european paradigms
	* different signals of negation (e.g. negative verb in uralic, tonal negation, etc.)
	* auxillary verbs, particles, and affixes
	* tripartite conjugation
* difficulty in demonstrating concepts whose syntax may change between language:
	* conjunction
	* negation
✓	* interrogatives
	* comparatives
	* relative clauses
	* different valencies

proposals:
* tokens anywhere can be inflected by any paradigm or class of word (noun, verb, etc.) 
* syntax specification is taken directly from wals-summary.tsv (e.g. snVom, etc.)
* language-agnostic decisions (e.g. how to demonstrate inflection) 
  are separated from language-specific decisions 
  (e.g. how meanings are conveyed with verbs, particles, inflections, word order, etc.)

questions that specification must answer:
* what semepoints must be demonstrated?
* what phrase or clause will convey that inflection?
	 	valency × subjectivity → tree
	where tree is:
		sVo, sV, da#Ng, etc.
* how does the language convey those semepoints?
	negation signaling
	question signaling
	inflection table signatures for each word
	any signaling using word order (e.g. interrogatives)
	any signaling using particles, auxillary verbs, phrases, etc. (e.g. tense, mood, negation, definiteness)
		examples for english:
			definiteness:
				add determiner with lemma "the" if definite
				add numeral with lemma "a" if indefinite
			tense:
				add auxillary verbs for certain tenses
			mood:
				add phrase literal for certain moods
			negation:
				add negator if negative
			interrogative:
				add wh-word or signal that a word is wh-, figure out which is easier
				use word order specified for circumstances where wh-word ("w") is present
		examples for uralic:
			negation:
				add verb with lemma "do-not" if negative
				add "-k" particle and sort as sₙVⁿo or inflect verb to have "-k" suffix
		examples for french:
			negation:
				add "ne" particle
				add "pas" particle
				order according to word order for negations, i.e. sₙVⁿo
	inflection tables for words/particles/markers


requirements:
	must demonstrate all inflections of all natural attested languages in complete sentences or noun phrases
	adjective agreement
	noun declension
	finite verb conjugation
	nonfinite verb conjugation:
		-ing noun ("supine")
		"to..." noun ("gerund")
		-ing adjective


test → dummy
test → template
test → tree

	examples:
	sVo
	sVoaN
	saNVo
	Ng
	s#NVoNg

test → test-dummy → tree

	examples:

	s 	test
	o 	dummy

	s 	test
	a 	falling
	V 	hit
	o 	

	N 	dummy
	g 	test

idea:
	representation in python still uses lists
	but string representation is basically toki pona syntax:
	. s a quick a brown N fox V jump o p over a lazy N dog
	[[s [a quick] [a brown] [N fox]] [V jump] [o [a lazy] [N dog]]]
	. s a quick a brown N fox V jump o p over a lazy N dog r V bit o man

assumed language invariants:
	the contents of a noun phrase (e.g. subject) never inflect for things outside of that phrase (e.g. direct-object)
