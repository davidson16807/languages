"""
"trees.py" contains functionality used to manipulate abstract syntax trees.

Two representations for syntax trees are available:
* syntax trees where nodes are simple python lists ("ListTrees")
* syntax trees where nodes are instances of a custom data type, "Rule" ("RuleTrees")

Both representations have their advantages.
ListTrees make it easy to perform simple operations like node replacement
RuleTrees condense ListTrees down to a form where it is easy to rearrange 
  grammatical elements based on tagaxes such as semantic role.

    The content of lists is roughly comparable to that of the phase marker notation used in linguiustics:
