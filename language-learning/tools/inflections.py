    # NOTE: "role" is used in the sense of "semantic role", a.k.a. "thematic relation": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_relation
    #   In our analysis, the "role" forms one part (an "episeme") of what is referred to here as "semantic case" (a "seme").
    #   The other part of semantic case is referred to as "motion", which is defined below.
    #   The term "semantic case" is used in a similar sense as "deep case" in existing literature.
    #   The term "semantic case" is introduced both to place distinction with "role" 
    #    and to create a paradigm where we map between language-agnostic "semantic" semes 
    #    and language-specific "grammatical" tags, e.g. "semantic mood" to "grammatical mood",  
    #    "semantic aspect" to "grammatical aspect", etc.
    #   Each language has a unique map from a semantic case to grammatical case, 
    #    and it is grammatical case that language learners are typically most familiar with (e.g. nominative, ablative, etc.)
    #   A language's map from semantic case to grammatical case is known as its "case usage".
    #   Semantic roles are also categorized into "macroroles" (i.e. subject, direct-object, indirect-object, adverbial) 
    #    and it is the macrorole that determines how noun phrases should be ordered within a clause.
    #   See README.txt and GLOSSARY.tsv for more information on these and related terms.
