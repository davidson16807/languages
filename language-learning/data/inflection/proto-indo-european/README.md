All Proto Indo European words in these decks are reconstructions as reported in Wikipedia and Wiktionary. 
Whereever Wikipedia/Wiktionary provides multiple reconstructions, we report the reconstruction by Sihler (1995).
Reconstructions for pronouns (including both declensions and possessive adjectives) report reconstructions for Late Proto Indo European.
Asterisks that denote reconstructions have been omitted to improve readability but are still implied.
