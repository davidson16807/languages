See GLOSSARY.tsv for a summary of the terms introduced here.

The terms used in this project are based on a systemization that was first adopted by Leonard Bloomfield in his book, "Language" (1933) 
then later expanded by Kenneth Pike in his own book ("Language in Relation to a Unified Theory of the Structure of Human Behavior", 1965).
The definitions given by Bloomfield in his book oftentimes appear ambiguous,
and this can be seen by the fact that later authors appear to mistakenly coopt these terms to other usage, 
with at least one attested admission to this (see Kenneth Pike, "Tagmemes née Grammees").
At this point it may be better to understand these terms as metasyntactic variables,
loosely corresponding to the definitions given by Bloomfield but whose precise definition varies by author.
For this reason we will attempt to remain consistent with the definitions that were provided by Leonard Bloomfield,
however we will provide our own definitions here for the terms as we use them.
The definitions we provide are meant to be grounded on a foundation of set theory and category theory,
but though we may occassionally dive into these subjects, we will still provide their definitions in terms that we expect nonexperts will understand.
This also makes our job easier, since we will not require ourselves to make precise mathematical formulations, though we may at times elude to what such things would look like.
We hope that in discussing definitions this way we will still at least offer greater clarity than what was seen while surveying the literature.

Our discussion of terminology begins by leveraging a set of preexisting terms from phonology: the terms "phone" and "phoneme". 
We will define a "phone" as *an indivisible unit of sound* that has been *attested to convey a distinction in meaning* within *any natural language*.
The phones are *initial objects* in categories where objects are *human utterances* and arrows map *how utterances compose from smaller utterances*.
The phones are *disjoint sets* of sound whose *union* is the infinitely subdivisible continuum of all sounds that have ever been made by humans during speech.
Another way to phrase this is to say the phones are *equivalence classes*, or the *fibers* of a *bundle* defined for some function mapping *sound→phone*.
More precisely, we define that any two sounds of the same phone can be interchanged 
in any statement of any attested natural language and still produce the same meaning.
This is to say that each phone is an *equalizer* of sounds for a given set of functions, which we will now attempt to define.

What follows is an attempted at formalization that can be skipped if desired.
Suppose there is a function f:U→(S+1) that maps any utterance (U) to the semantic meaning (S) received by an audience in that language, or no meaning (1) if the utterance is unintelligible.
Suppose there is also a function: g:L→P(U) that for any any attested natural language maps to the set of all meaningful utterances made in that language, such that ∀u∈g(l):f(u)∈S. 
For every l∈L, and for every utterance u∈g(l), we say there is a function, h(l,u):P×P→U that replaces every instance of one sound in a phone P with another in the utterance u
The phone is then the following equalizer:
	Eq({f∘h(l,u) | l∈L, u∈g(l)})

Likewise, we will define a "phoneme" as *an indivisible unit of sound* that is *capable of conveying a distinction in meaning* within *a given language*.
The phonemes of a language are disjoint sets of phones whose union is what is known as the *phoneme inventory* of that language.
The phonemes are defined such that any two phones of the same phoneme can be interchanged 
in any statement of the phonemes' language and still produce the same meaning.

In another skippable attempt at formalization,
the phonemes are equivalently described as equalizers of phones for a set of functions:
	Eq({f∘hₘ(u) | u∈g(l)})
where l∈L is a language, f and g match the definitions above, and hₘ(u):Pₘ×Pₘ→U replaces every instance of one sound in a phoneme Pₘ with another in the utterance u

To illustrate, in Japanese there is no distinction between the phones made by the letters "l" and "r",
so to Japanese speakers the English words "lap" and "rap" may sound indistinguishable despite being different words.
Meanwhile in English you can choose to roll the letter "r" without altering the meaning of words,
however doing so in Spanish might cause the word for "but" ("pero") to be mistaken for the word for "dog" ("perro").
We therefore say in Japanese the sounds conveyed by letters "l" and "r" correspond to the same phoneme,
whereas in English "l" and "r" correspond to different phonemes but not the sounds that correspond to the rolled and unrolled "r",
and in Spanish all three sounds correspond to different phonemes.
If Japanese, English, and Spanish were the only natural languages ever to have been attested,
we would then have to declare that the "rolled r", "unrolled r", and "l" were each instances of a phone.

The system of phonemes that are used by a language are known as that language's "phonemics",
whereas the study of phones across all languages is known as "phonetics". 
We therefore create a distinction between what are known as "-emic" and "-etic" units,
where "-etic" units (indicated here without a suffix) apply to all attested natural languages,
and "-emic" units (suffixed by "-eme") are specific to a given language.

Just as "-emic" and "-etic" units can be assigned precise mathematical definitions in phonology,
so too can can we create units that are analogous to these definitions in other categories.
Let's say there is an arbitrary concept, labeled "term", that represents an "-etic" unit.
As an "-etic" unit, it is analogous to a phone. 
As such, it is an indivisible unit that is defined by some property when considering all natural attested languages, 
and it is an initial object of some kind in a larger category.
Its "-emic" unit, "termeme", represents one of several disjoint sets, the union of which is the set of all terms.
This set of functions can be partitioned into disjoint subsets, and to each disjoint subset there exists a set of "-emic" units.
In the context of linguistics, we will say that every natural language that has ever been attested 
maps to its own disjoint set of functions that an "-emic" unit concerns itself with,
and any "-etic" unit in linguistics always considers in some way all attested natural languages.

We will next enumerate the terms that have resulted from us applying this technique.

Just as a "phoneme" describes an indivisible unit of sound that is capable of *representing a distinction* in a language,
a "morpheme" is said to describe an indivisible unit of sound that is capable of *conveying a distinct meaning* in a language.
To illustrate, in Japanese the morpheme "ga" is a particle that follows a word to indicate the subject of a sentence,
and in English "-able" (in words such as "doable") is a suffix that is used to indicate when an action indicated by a verb can be performed.
By analogy a "morph" is an indivisible unit of sound capable of conveying *any meaning* in *any attested natural language*. 
Multiple morphs may correspond to the same morpheme, so for instance in English the "-ible" suffix in a word such as "feasible" 
is seen as equivalent in meaning as the "-able" suffix in a word such as "doable". Both are each recognized by English speakers 
as being part of the same morpheme, which broadly represents how some variant of "-[ia]ble" can be tacked onto a verb to indicate potentiality.
Examples of homomorphs in English include the "-s" suffix that indicates the plural of a noun ("the cats run")
and the "-'s" suffix (with appostrophe) that indicates the possessive of a noun ("the cat's ear")

Likewise, a "sememe" is said to be the equivalence class of meanings (or "semes") that are suggested by a morpheme, 
of which one of the "semes" represents what the speaker *intends* to communicate. 
During speech, the speaker must map the seme he intends to communicate to a "sememe" that can be conveyed by a morpheme. 
The concept of the seme and sememe is useful for conveying certain distinctions in meaning that may be present in one language but not another.
To illustrate, speakers of Ergative-Absolutive languages distinguish morphemes based upon whether a verb is transitive or intransitive,
whereas speakers of Nominative-Accusative languages are wholly unfamiliar with these distinctions and do not mark them in any way.
The morphemes that indicate a "subject" in a Nominative-Accusative language correspond to sememes that refer 
to the semes of both the "solitary" and "agent" of the Ergative-Absolutive languages.
If one were able to create a system that could represent any distinction present in the morphemes of any attested natural language,
such a system would consist of a set of "semes". Each "seme" represents an equivalence class of meanings 
that cannot be further distinguished in any attested natural language without introducing additional morphemes.
A sememe is therefore merely any distinction that can be represented a single language. 
To return to our example, one possible seme the "solitary subject" concept (together with whatever else is indicated by a morph), 
and in a single Nominative-Accusative language, one possible sememe is the "nominative" concept (together with whatever else is indicated by a morpheme).

We will now make an observation: a "seme" is not strictly indivisible as a unit of meaning. 
A seme *can* be decomposed further into smaller units, and these units will still have meaning, 
however *these units will not correspond to any morpheme*, and this was an essential property of a seme,
so these subdivided units cannot be called "semes", and they must be called by a different word.
To illustrate this point, in Spanish "-[ai]steis" is a morpheme that indicates 
that an audience of several people has completed at some point in the past an action that is indicated by the verb being inflected.
The sememe that maps to this morpheme must therefore simultanesously represent the second person, plural number, past tense, and perfect aspect.
"-[ai]ste" is another morpheme, and the sememe that maps to this morpheme simultaneously represents the same things, except for singular number instead of plural.
"-[ai]steis" cannot be decomposed into "-[ai]ste"+"-is" since "-is" carries no meaning in this context,
so they are clearly indivisible, they are indeed Spanish morphemes, and their sememes are also indivisible,
however the language also clearly allows a distinction between sememes of plural number (like "-[ai]steis") and sememes of singular number (like "-[ai]ste"). 
We should therefore introduce a new term to describe such a distinction. The term we use is "tag".
The "-emic" unit of a tag is a "tagmeme". Plural and singular are both instances of a "tagmeme" in Spanish.

Plural and singular the only two tagmemes in Spanish that represent "grammatical number".
Other languages have different tagmemes that represent grammatical number, such as paucal or superplural,
and if we compiled a list of all such distinctions in all natural attested languages,
we would have a set of "tags". The concept of "number" is classically referred to as a "grammatical category",
but in this body of work we will refer to this concept as a "tagaxis".
We do so because the "-axis" suffix permits a far more productive paradigm. 
An "-axis" simply describes a set containing sets. Each nested set corresponds to a term. 
The root that it modifies indicates what type of seme set is being referred to.

Up to present, we can establish the following termaxes:
* *phonaxes*   are sets of mutually exclusive phones whose product defines a parameter space of syllables. Examples of phonaxes are consonant, vowel, etc.
* *morphaxes*  are sets of mutually exclusive morphs whose product defines words and phrases. Examples of morphaxes are suffix, prefix, noun root, verb root, etc.
* *semaxes*    are sets of mutually exclusive semes whose product defines larger constructs of meaning. Examples of semaxes are the meanings that underlie suffix, prefix, noun, verb, etc.
* *tagaxes*    are sets of mutually exclusive tags whose product with other tagaxes defines a parameter space of morphemes. Examples of tagaxes are case, tense, aspect, number, gender, etc.

Equivalent "termemeaxes" can be constructed for respective termemes. 
For instance a "tagmemaxis" is analogous to a tagaxis for a given language. 

The "-axis" suffix permits an extended metaphor that leverages concepts in geometry.
If we have a cartesian product of termaxes that each correspond to the same term, the result is a "termspace":
* *phonspace*   a space of syllables formed over a product of phonaxes
* *morphspace*  a space of words or phrases formed over a product of morphaxes
* *semspace*    a space of meanings formed over a product of semaxes
* *tagspace*    a space of morphs formed over a product of tagaxes

And a "-point" refers to a member of such a termspace:
* *phonpoint*   a point within a phonspace, which could represent a syllable
* *morphpoint*  a point within a morphspace, which could represent a word
* *sempoint*    a point within a semspace, which represent meanings
* *tagpoint*    a point within a tagspace, which could represent a seme or morph

We lastly note that a termaxis is merely a set of sets. 
It is not a mathematical bundle, since its sets need not be disjoint.
There is also no requirement that tags represent disjoint sets of semes,
and so we know specifically that a tagaxis is not a bundle.
To return to our earlier example, grammatical number is a tagaxis comprised of singular, paucal, plural, etc.,
but paucal in one language refers to a subset of the semes that plural refers to in another.
There's no reason that an "-axis" can't be a bundle under the right circumstances.
We argue that a tagmemaxis is a bundle, since to illustrate with Spanish, 
a seme cannot be both singular and plural.
This is, however, a "-emic" concept specific to a language.
It would be desireable to have a language-agnostic concept that represents mutual exclusivity.
We therefore introduce another term that is similar to a tag but whose definition is more strict,
such that the members of its axis are mutually exclusive.
Coopting the term introduced by Bloomfield (1933), we will call this an "episeme".
An episeme behaves much like a tag, however it carries the additional criteria 
that episemes of the same episemaxis are mutually exclusive.
To illustrate, "mood", "aspect", and "case" are tagaxes that are typically used in the analysis of grammar.
"mood" includes things such as "subjunctive", but subjunctive has many applications, 
such as to represent doubt, negation, conditionals, or desire
"aspect" includes things such as "imperfective",
which could indicate many things that in certain languages could be their own aspect, 
such as whether something is unfinished, or started without specifying completion, or paused.
"case" includes things such as "accusative", which we've already seen could also represent the absolutive case.
If one were to create a system that represented these tags as the composition of mutually exclusive units,
such units would be episemes.
