"Tsan Chanese" is a hypothetical language constructed for the H.P. Lovecraft mythos. It accompanies an expansion to the Call of Cthulhu table top game, called "The Cruel Empire of Tsan Chan". 

The language is spoken in what is now modern day China in the year 5000 A.D., in an hypothetical timeline where the cosmic entity "Cthulhu" wakes from his sleep and precipitates a new dark age. The timeline which characterizes the evolution of the language is as follows:

# 2000
Mandarin is the official language of modern day China

# 2000-2500
Scientists begin to press against the limits of comfortable human understanding.
Many of the most talented scientists abandon their fields or succumb to worse fates, 
leaving their less talented colleagues to pick up where they left off.
Human technological progress continues but faces increasing stagnation on account of these limits.
Mandarin and English undergo typical sound changes. Additional borrowings bring English words into Mandarin.

The resulting languages are addressed as "neo-Mandarin" and "neo-English"

# 2518
Death of Australian physicist Nevil Kingston-Brown, evidenced in H.P. Lovecraft's "The Shadow out of Time".

The death of Nevil Kingston-Brown is used in this analysis to mark the year that Cthulhu wakes from his sleep.
This is because certain facts within the story lend itself to this hypothesis.
The protagonist writes:

> I talked with... the Australian physicist Nevil Kingston-Brown, who will die in 2,518 A.D.

The protagonist of that story would not have likely learned of a man's death by interviewing with him,
and the story makes no allotment for strange explanations like revivification,
so the protagonist must have learned of his death from either interviewing with other humans or reading their accounts.
However the other humans that are mentioned in the story are very widely dispersed through time,
typically separated in time by centuries or even millenia,
so there must have been some other noteworthy event that occurred in 2518 
by which the protagonist could have inferred the death of the man.
Whatever this event was, it would have been noteworthy enough to be remembered in other accounts, centuries or millenia afterward.
The protagonist certainly lends himself to this idea, stating:

> What was hinted in the speech of post-human entities of the fate of mankind produced such an effect on me that I will not set it down here.

Though many apocalyptic events are possible in the Lovecraft mythos, 
the rise of Cthulhu is the only one known to have occurred within this timeline.

In 2518, Cthulu rises from his sleep, and soon after the vast majority of humanity either dies or falls to insanity under his influence.
China is among the last nations to fall. Refugees flood into China, speaking predominantly neo-English.
A pidgin language emerges, based primarily out of neo-Mandarin with neo-English loanwords. 
As with both it's source languages, the resulting "pidgin Chinese" is an analytic language that uses SVO sentence structure.
The simplified grammar of Mandarin is retained. Sentence structure largely models English where differences exist. 
The phonetic structure of Mandarin words are retained in English loan words.
Tonality is completely removed. The resulting ambiguity is addressed by reduplication and particle words.
Words of a scientific nature, for instance the regions of electromagnetic spectrum, are forgotten with the rest of science.

# 2518-3500?
Descendants of survivors remain in remote caverns of western China.
Survivors are protected only by the influence of the Elder god Nyarlathotep 
and Lovecraftian races such as the Ophidians.
A caste of priests emerge to worship and conspire with these beings, known as the "Deathless".
The language of the Deathless is a creole descended from pidgin Chinese.
It borrows heavily from Ophidian words, especially words that describe concepts within the Lovecraft mythos,
and words for scientific concepts which were previous lost to time.

Ophidian loan words share the same phonology as the Ophidian language, 
which is heavily constrained to the sounds allowed by their reptilian vocal tract.
See [here](https://youtu.be/8vahlnBkVUA?t=294) for ideas on what this may look like.
The language is indeed comprised mostly of fricatives, as one might expect.

Some of loan words from Ophidian replace earlier scientific neologism which were lost when Cthulhu woke.
For instance, the word for "infrared" is borrowed from an Ophidian word 
meaning an equivalent primary color that only the Ophidians can perceive.

Outside the caverns of western China, the thralls of Cthulhu speak different languages.
These languages retain most of the features of their substrate languages (e.g. tonality)
but only retain the most conserved words within theri vocabularies.
The majority of words in these languages are borrowed from the language of the Great Old Ones, 
referred to here as "R'lyehian". (See [here](http://yog-sothoth.com/wiki/index.php/R%27lyehian) for known vocabulary)
All but the most concerved words are borrowed.
Language borrowing mirrors the kind of borrowing that occurred in English during the Norman Invasion, 
or Vietnamese during the Han dynasty.
Native words are replace across most of the semantic fields 
that are commonly associated with religious influence and military conquest.
This includes words relating to religious terminology, social strata, law, warfare, 
and of course words that express concepts specific to the Lovecraft mythos.
Notably absent are words for fashion, cuisine, and literature, 
since there is no concept for such things among these people.

Of course, words from the substrate language are not left completely untouched.
Even the most conserved words submit to strange sound laws. 
These sound laws serve to expand the phonetic inventories of substrate languages,
making use of distinctions that are important within R'lyehian, 
while also torturously slurring loan words that were never meant for human tongues.

# 3500-4000?
Deathless priests emerge from their caverns to capture and enslave thralls of Cthulhu, known as "Dreamers". 
The descendants of these thralls are spared from Cthulhu's influence, 
allowing them to provide useful slave labor to the Deathless.
These slaves eventually become the lower caste in the future Empire of Tsan Chan,
and they constitute the majority of that empire's population.
Their language is descended from that of the thralls, 
but with many borrowings from the Deathless, again for semantic fields associated with military conquest:
social strata, law, warfare, but also fashion, cuisine, literature, philosophy,
and terminology for concepts that are specific to the game expansion, such as the Inderdiction or the Judgement.
We will refer to this language as the "Serf" language.

The resulting language is analytical, with an SVO sentence structure.
The most conserved words in the language are derived from Mandarin and retain tonality, 
but have undergone many unusual sound laws.
Words for concepts specific to the Lovecraft mythos are based on R'lyehian.
Words of a scientific, philosophical, or technological nature are based on the Ophidian language.
Words for concepts specific to the game expansion are also based on the Ophidian language.
Words for social strata, law, warfare, fashion, cuisine, literature, and philosophy 
are derived from "Deathless", which is an alternate lineage of Mandarin where tonality was abandoned and replaced 
with reduplication and particles, and from R'leyhian for more conserved words.

Other languages exist throughout the empire, 
which reflect Dreamer languages that were derived from other modern day languages 
of nearby lands such as Vietnamese and Korean.
These languages underwent similar borrowings and sound laws from contact with R'lyehian and then the Deathless.

Additionally, the Deathless language itself evolves, 
undergoing many of the same sound laws that were experienced by underclass languages,
eventually becoming the court language spoken amongst servants of the Empress, the "Eunuchs".
Unlike many court languages in history, the court language of the Tsan Chanese 
uses vocabulary borrowed from radically different languages,
and if not for some highly conserved words it would be considered a separate language family.

# 4000-5000?
Projects are undertaken to mix the blood lines of humans with cosmic entities, 
creating a new nobility class that allow the fortunes of the Empire to be briefly reversed.
Progress is made in science during this time. Several lost concepts and technologies are rediscovered.
Neologisms are created to describe rediscovered concepts, 
and many of these words are derived from existing words within Court language.
