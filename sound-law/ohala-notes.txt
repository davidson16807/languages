			voiced stops
				voicing requires air flow through the glottis
				stops quickly build up pressure in the mouth to match the subglottis, 
					thereby ending air flow
				stops can be lengthened but only by active measures,
					this is easier if stop occurs at the back of the mouth 
					where there is more room for expansion,
					or if speaker resorts to using implosives,
					or if the speaker introduces a phoneme such as a nasal
				therefore:
					the longer or further back the stop closure is made, the more likely devoicing occurs
					if devoicing sound laws occur they will occur at back of the mouth
					languages without voicing constrast invariably use voiceless
					languages that use voicing constrast in stops 
						will have gaps in voiced series at the back of the mouth, if anywhere
			voiced fricatives
				frication is a function of air velocity
				air velocity is a function of flow (volume velocity), and therefore air pressure
				therefore high air pressure is required for effective frication
				however low air pressure is required to continue voicing
				therefore, voiced fricatives have a tendency to either devoice or defricativize
			vowel closeness
				close vowels like u or i cause greater constriction and therefore lower subglottal pressure
				final vowels also require that airflow seize to indicate the pause at a word boundary
				therefore final close vowels are more likely than other vowels to be dropped
			fricatives with close vowels
				frication is a function of air velocity
				for a given flow (volume velocity), velocity increases as flow channel is constricted (the Bernoulli effect)
				therefore frication is more likely to occur following close vowels and glides
			ejectives
				ejectives require less force to produce compared to their nonejective counterparts when at high altitude
				therefore at high altitude substitution may be performed to clarify statements while conserving energy
			obstruents 
				obstruents create short bursts due to create rapid equalization in air pressure
				so they create more rapid spectral changes and can carry more information
				therefore, languages with larger sound inventories will have greater ratios of obstruents
				however it is also more difficult to perceive these distinctions, 
				especially over long distances,
				therefore warmer climates where speakers talk in less confined spaces 
				will tend towards sound laws that favor sonority
				a possible example is English "nothing" /nəθɪŋ/ → /nəfɪŋ/, 
				which is further helped along due to sound similarity as mentioned in "errors in comprehension"
		elasto-inertial
			vocal chords have greater control over pitch when operating in warm, humid environments
			therefore if a mispronunciation occurs that uses pitch to convey what was phoneme, 
			it is more likely to be received

		miscellaneous/unknown
			sonorority
			implosives
				implosives are more likely to occur in humid climates
					the mechanism is unknown
