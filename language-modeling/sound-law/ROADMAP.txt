TODO:
sound laws
	compile a list of sound laws that are attested in historical linguistics, denoted in ipa using regex substitutions
	compile a list of pronunciations within a target language, denoted in ipa
	map text or vocabulary lists in target language to ipa and perform regex substitutions to mimic sound laws
word borrowing
	compile vocabulary for source languages
	compile a lookup that indicates semantic field for english words (e.g. warfare, religion, cuisine, fashion, various technologies, etc.)
	compile a map between forms of linguistic influence (e.g. military conquest, religious expansion, cultural influence, technological advancement) to semantic field
	during mass word borrowing events, map the kind of influence to semantic field, and modify words with that semantic field in source language vocabulary, 
		either replacing words with those of the influencing language or introducing new words from the influencing language, depending on the kind of influence
pidginization
	compile synonym pairs for english
	during pidginization, randomly select a word from each synonym group and replace all words in that group with the randomly selected word
